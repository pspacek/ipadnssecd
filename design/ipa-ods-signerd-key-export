Synchronizes PKCS#11 keys from local HSM to LDAP. It is done in three stages:

1) replica keys
- download (from LDAP) and import new public keys with CKA_WRAP = TRUE
- delete keys removed from LDAP from local HSM (optional for now?)
- synchronize attributes for existing keys (matching IDs)

2) master key
a)if a replica key was deleted:
-- set CKA_WRAP = FALSE on old replica keys
-- generate new master key
-- wrap new master key using public keys of all active replicas
-- set CKA_WRAP = FALSE on old master key

b)if a new replica key was added:
-- wrap existing master key with the new replica public key

3) DNSSEC keys
- wrap DNSSEC keys using latest master key (CKA_WRAP = TRUE)
